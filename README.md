# DefectCorrectionsNotebook

## Introduction
This project contains a workflow which aims to allow for convenient and explanatory post-processing of charged defect supercells from electronic structure calculations with the all-electron electronic structure software package [FHI-aims](https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/).

## Usage
The notebook in this repository (DefectCorrectionsNotebook.ipynb) can be used to peform the Lany-Zunger (LZ) finite-size correction scheme (doi: 10.1088/0965-0393/17/8/084002) or the Freysoldt, Neugebauer and Van de Walle (FNV) finite-size correction scheme (doi: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.016402) with the option for the potential alignment step to use either planar averages or atom centres with the sampling region proposed by Kumagai and Oba (doi: 10.1103/PhysRevB.89.195205). However, if the defect supercell has been relaxed, the use of atom centres is highly recommended. To view a demo of the notebook see [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/skw32/DefectCorrectionsNotebook/blob/master/DefectCorrectionsNotebook.ipynb).

This notebook can also be run as a script for a set of data generated by FHI-aims for charged defect calculation using 'DefectCorrectionsDataset.py'.

## Known issues and limitations
This project is currently under development. Tests are currently being run to determine sensible default parameters (although there will later always be the option for manual override by the user). The project is currently only able to perform corrections for intrinsic point defects.

## Installation instructions

First download a copy of the repository. All analysis should be performed from the directory containing the notebook file (DefectCorrectionsNotebook.ipynb). The following information is also contained within the notebook, but is repeated here for completeness.

This workflow uses python3. The most convenient way to setup the python environment for this workflow is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). The notebook should be run within this conda environment.


### Option 1: Create your conda env directly from the .yml file
All dependencies present when testing this workflow are listed in DefectCorrectionsCondaEnv.yml. This environment can be re-created using conda with 

`conda env create -n YourChosenEnvName --file DefectCorrectionsCondaEnv.yml` 

To use this workflow you must then activate this conda environment with 

`conda activate YourChosenEnvName`

### Option 2: Create your conda env manually

Alternatively, a conda environment can be created for this workflow and the necessary packages installed one at a time, as outlined below

`conda create -n YourChosenEnvName python=3.6`

`conda activate YourChosenEnvName`

`conda install -c suzannekwallace -c conda-forge coffee_poisson_solver_ko pylada`

`conda install jupyter pytest pytest-cov`

`pip install NotebookScripter coveralls`


## Project components

- DefectCorrectionsNotebook.ipynb: contains all of the processing steps (and explanations) for performing finite-size correction schemes to obtain the defect formation energy for charged defect supercells, for one defect at a time. More information on the correction schemes and processing steps is contained in the notebook. 
- DefectCorrectionsDataset.py: allows for running the notebook from the command line for a set of defect supercells data. Further instructions are contained in comments at the top of the script.
- DefectSupercellAnalyses.py: This contains functions used in the notebook workflow that were written for reading in structural information of defect supercells in the geometry file format of FHI-aims ('geometry.in').
- CoffeeConvenienceFunctions.py: This contains functions used in the notebook workflow to automatically generate input files for the [CoFFEE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465518300158) software package for performing processing steps for applying corrections to charged defect supercells.
- AtomPotentialAlignment.py: This file contains functions used for performing the potential alignment method with atom-centres and the Kumagai-Oba sampling region (doi: 10.1103/PhysRevB.89.195205) with outputs from FHI-aims, as an alternative to the default in CoFFEE to use planar averages.
- PyladaDefectsImageCharge.py: This file contains functions used for calculating the image-interaction correction from the LZ correction scheme using functions adapted with permission from [pylada-defects](https://github.com/pylada/pylada-defects).
- LogFileSetup.py: This file contains the default format of the log file used to store intermediate processing results from the notebook.
- PlottingFunctions.py: This contains functions called in the notebook to generate various plots.
- DefectCorrectionsCondaEnv.yml: This file stored the conda environment used to run this workflow (see installation instructions below).
- coffee.py: This is the main executable for the [CoFFEE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465518300158) package (from version 1.1) that is used in this workflow.
- tests: This directory contains tests for functions written for this workflow and sample data to use with the tests.
- sample_data contains some sample defect data for running the notebook. 
- conftest.py is a configuration file for pytest to define the root directory for the testsuite.
- .travis.yml and .coveragerc are files required for Travis-CI and test coverage respectively.
