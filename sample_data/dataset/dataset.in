#The whole information about your defect dataset 
#The base_dir are your directory where contain your whole defect types, which must be specified in the DefectCorrectionsDataset.py    
#The structure of this file should follow the following structures 
# [Output_dir] [Neutral_defect_dir] [Charge_defect_dir] [Charge_states]
# The absolute path to your neutral_defect would be   /base_dir/Neutral_defect_dir 
# The absolute path to your charge defect would be   /base_dir/Charge_defect_dir 
#
# For Planer average potential alignment: 
#        if you want to obtain the potential alignment plots as those in the original COFFEE paper:  
#           You must offer the neutral_defect properties(potential and geometry). Otherwise, the output from the code would be problamatic
#        if you want to obtain the potential alignment plot as that in the original FNV paper: 
#           you can omit the neutral_defect properties. By doing this, you can just set the [Neutral_defect_dir] as that in [Charge_defect_dir] 
# For Atom average potential alignment: 
#        you can direct omit the neutral_defect properties. By doing this, you can just set the [Neutral_defect_dir] as that in [Charge_defect_dir]
